8. Place your model.pth and model.index inside path\to\Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI\assets\weights

10. it's now time to edit some directories inside index.js and infer_rvc.py.

### Editing Directories.

You must change this into the installation folder of your RVC library

You must also change this into their corresponding directories

removing MODEL_NAME and INDEX_PATH from the list of variables to declutter will work as only the one in rvc_cmd is used.
### Some Finalizations:
- Install ffmpeg and dotenv with pip.
